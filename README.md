# Memory cards

## Introduction

I built this project as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) React lesson.

This is a game where you can test your memory by picking images you have not picked before.

Live demo available [HERE](https://wiz1991.github.io/memory-cards/)

### How to play

- You have 20 cards to pick from
- Each click on a new card will shuffle the images
- If you click on an image twice, you lose
- If you pick all 20 images without click twice on any of them, you win
